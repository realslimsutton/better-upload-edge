title: Upload Routes
---

Upload routes are where you define how files are uploaded. To define a route, use the `route` function.

You can create multiple routes for different purposes (e.g. images, videos).

<PageSelect
  pages={[
    {
      href: '/docs/routes-multiple',
      title: 'Multiple files',
      description: 'Upload more than one file at once.',
    },
    {
      href: '/docs/routes-single',
      title: 'Single files',
      description: 'Upload only a single file at once.',
    },
  ]}
/>

Here is a basic example of a multiple file upload route:

```ts
import { route } from 'better-upload/server';

route({
  multipleFiles: true,
  fileTypes: ['image/*'], // Accepts all image types
  maxFileSize: 1024 * 1024 * 4, // 4MB
});
```

Multiple file routes have the following options:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    maxFiles: {
      description: 'The maximum number of files that can be uploaded at once.',
      type: 'number',
      default: 3,
      required: false,
    },
    fileTypes: {
      description: (
        <>
          An array of file types to accept. Use any valid MIME type. You can use
          wildcards like <code>image/*</code>.
        </>
      ),
      type: 'string[]',
      default: 'All file types allowed',
      required: false,
    },
    maxFileSize: {
      description: 'The maximum file size in bytes.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '5242880 (5MB)',
      required: false,
    },
    signedUrlExpiresIn: {
      description: 'The time in seconds the upload pre-signed URL is valid.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '120 (2 minutes)',
      required: false,
    },
    clientMetadataSchema: {
      description:
        'Schema for validating metadata sent from the client. Use any validation library compatible with Standard Schema, like Zod.',
      type: 'object',
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

## Callbacks

When defining a route, you may want to run code before or after the upload. You can do this by using the callbacks.

### Before upload

The `onBeforeUpload` callback is called before pre-signed URLs are generated. Use this to run custom logic before uploading files, such as auth and rate-limiting.

The request, files, and metadata sent from the client are available.

```ts
route({
  onBeforeUpload: async ({ req, files, clientMetadata }) => {
    const user = await auth();

    if (!user) {
      throw new RejectUpload('Not logged in!');
    }

    return {
      generateObjectInfo: ({ file }) => ({
        key: `${user.id}/${file.name}`,
      }),
      bucketName: 'another-bucket',
    };
  },
});
```

<Callout title="Rejecting uploads">
  Throw `RejectUpload` to reject the file upload. This will also send the error
  message to the client.
</Callout>

You can return an object with the following properties:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    generateObjectInfo: {
      description:
        'Information about the S3 object. Includes the object key, metadata, ACL, and other properties.',
      type: '() => object',
      typeDescription: (
        <>
          Can return: <code>key</code>, <code>metadata</code>, <code>acl</code>,{' '}
          <code>storageClass</code>, <code>cacheControl</code>.
        </>
      ),
      required: false,
    },
    metadata: {
      description: (
        <>
          Metadata to be passed to the <code>onAfterSignedUrl</code> callback.
        </>
      ),
      type: 'object',
      required: false,
    },
    bucketName: {
      description:
        'If you wish to upload to a bucket different from the one defined in the router, you can specify its name here.',
      type: 'string',
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

### After generating pre-signed URL

The `onAfterSignedUrl` callback is called after the pre-signed URLs are generated. Use this to run custom logic after the URL is generated, such as logging and saving data.

In addition to all previous data, metadata from the `onBeforeUpload` callback is also available.

```ts
route({
  onAfterSignedUrl: async ({ req, files, metadata, clientMetadata }) => {
    // the files now have the objectKey property

    return {
      metadata: {
        example: '123',
      },
    };
  },
});
```

You can return an object with the following properties:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    metadata: {
      description:
        'Metadata to be sent back to the client. Needs to be JSON serializable.',
      type: 'object',
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

## Multipart uploads

If you want to upload files larger than **5GB**, you need to use multipart uploads. To enable it, set `multipart` to `true`. It works both for single and multiple files. No change is needed in the client.

```ts
route({
  multipleFiles: true,
  multipart: true, // [!code highlight]
  partSize: 1024 * 1024 * 20, // 20MB, default is 50MB [!code highlight]
});
```

You can now also modify the following options:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    partSize: {
      description: 'The size of each part in bytes.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '52428800 (50MB)',
      required: false,
    },
    partSignedUrlExpiresIn: {
      description: 'The time in seconds the part pre-signed URL is valid.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '1500 (25 minutes)',
      required: false,
    },
    completeSignedUrlExpiresIn: {
      description: 'The time in seconds the complete pre-signed URL is valid.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '1800 (30 minutes)',
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

<Callout>
  Even for files under 5GB, using multipart uploads can speed up the upload
  process. Empty files (0 bytes) will fail to upload with multipart uploads.
</Callout>

## Router

The router is where all upload routes are defined. To define a router, create an object with the `Router` type.

```ts
import { type Router } from 'better-upload/server';

export const router: Router = {
  client: s3,
  bucketName: 'my-bucket',
  routes: {
    // your routes...
  },
};
```
