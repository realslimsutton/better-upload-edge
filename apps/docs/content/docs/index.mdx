## Why?

After needing to implement file uploads from scratch in multiple projects, I realized that there was a need for a better and simpler way to set up file uploads in React while still owning my S3 bucket. I wanted a library that was easy to use, fast to set up, and not bloated with features I didn't need. So I made Better Upload.

## Universal

Better Upload is framework-agnostic, meaning you can use it with any React framework, like [Next.js](https://nextjs.org), [Remix](https://remix.run), [TanStack Start](https://tanstack.com/start), or any other. It also works with any separate backend server that uses standard Request and Response objects, like [Hono](https://hono.dev).

## Developer Experience

When creating Better Upload, my main focus was on making the developer experience as smooth as possible.

- **Fast to set up:** It takes only a few minutes to get started and upload files directly to your S3 bucket.
- **Beautiful:** There are copy-and-paste [shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com) components that you can use to rapidly build your UI.
- **Own your data:** Upload files directly to your S3 bucket, so you have full control over files.

## LLMs

AI agents can access the Better Upload documentation in Markdown by:

- **Full docs:** [`llms-full.txt`](./llms-full.txt) - contains the complete documentation in plain Markdown.
- **Per-page content:** Every page in the docs is available as `.mdx`. For example, [`/docs/quickstart.mdx`](./docs/quickstart.mdx)
