## Usage

The `<UploadDropzoneProgress />` should be used with the `useUploadFiles` hook.

```tsx
'use client';

import { useUploadFiles } from 'better-upload/client';
import { UploadDropzoneProgress } from '@/components/ui/upload-dropzone-progress';

export function Uploader() {
  const { control } = useUploadFiles({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return <UploadDropzoneProgress control={control} accept="image/*" />;
}
```

When clicked, the dropzone will open a file picker dialog. When selected or dropped, the files will be uploaded to the desired route.

### Description

You can customize the description shown in the dropzone. You can pass a string, or an object with the following properties:

- `maxFiles`: The maximum number of files that can be uploaded.
- `maxFileSize`: The maximum size of the files that can be uploaded, use a formatted string (e.g. `10MB`).
- `fileTypes`: The file types that can be uploaded.

```tsx
<UploadDropzone
  control={control}
  accept="image/*"
  description={{
    maxFiles: 4,
    maxFileSize: '2MB',
    fileTypes: 'JPEG, PNG, GIF',
  }}
/>
```
