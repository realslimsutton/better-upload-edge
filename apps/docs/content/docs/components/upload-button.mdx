## Usage

The `<UploadButton />` should be used with the `useUploadFile` hook.

```tsx
'use client';

import { useUploadFile } from 'better-upload/client';
import { UploadButton } from '@/components/ui/upload-button';

export function Uploader() {
  const { control } = useUploadFile({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return <UploadButton control={control} accept="image/*" />;
}
```

The button will open a file picker dialog when clicked, and upload the selected file to the desired route.
