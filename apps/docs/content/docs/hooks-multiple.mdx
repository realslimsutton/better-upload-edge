title: Client Hooks
---

Better Upload provides React hooks that allow you to easily upload files using pre-signed URLs. Multipart uploads are managed automatically, in case you enable them in the server.

<PageSelect
  pages={[
    {
      href: '/docs/hooks-multiple',
      title: 'Multiple files',
      description: 'Upload more than one file at once.',
    },
    {
      href: '/docs/hooks-single',
      title: 'Single files',
      description: 'Upload only a single file at once.',
    },
  ]}
/>

## Usage

```tsx title="my-component.tsx"
import { useUploadFiles } from 'better-upload/client';

export function MyComponent() {
  const {
    upload,
    uploadAsync,
    reset,
    uploadedFiles,
    failedFiles,
    progresses,
    isPending,
    isAborted,
    isSettled,
    isError,
    allSucceeded,
    hasFailedFiles,
    averageProgress,
    error,
    metadata,
    control, // for use in pre-built components
  } = useUploadFiles({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      multiple
      onChange={(e) => {
        if (e.target.files) {
          upload(e.target.files);
        }
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  If your upload route handler is not located at `/api/upload`, you need to
  specify the correct path in the `api` option.
</Callout>

### Options

The `useUploadFiles` hook accepts the following options:

<TypeTable
  type={{
    route: {
      description:
        'The route to use for uploading files. Needs to match the upload route in the server.',
      type: 'string',
      required: true,
    },
    api: {
      description: 'The API endpoint to use for uploading files.',
      type: 'string',
      default: '/api/upload',
      required: false,
    },
    uploadBatchSize: {
      description: 'The number of files to upload in parallel.',
      type: 'number',
      default: 'All files at once',
      required: false,
    },
    multipartBatchSize: {
      description:
        'The number of parts that will be uploaded in parallel when uploading a file.',
      type: 'number',
      default: 'All parts at once',
      required: false,
    },
    signal: {
      description: 'Abort signal to cancel the upload.',
      type: 'AbortSignal',
      required: false,
    },
    headers: {
      description:
        'Headers to send to your server when requesting the pre-signed URLs.',
      type: 'HeadersInit',
      typeDescription: 'Can be an object with string keys and values.',
      required: false,
    },
    credentials: {
      description:
        'Credentials mode when requesting pre-signed URLs from your server.',
      type: 'RequestCredentials',
      typeDescription: (
        <>
          Can be <code>include</code>, <code>same-origin</code>, or{' '}
          <code>omit</code>.
        </>
      ),
      required: false,
    },
    retry: {
      description: 'Number of times to retry network requests that fail.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '0',
      required: false,
    },
    retryDelay: {
      description: 'Delay in milliseconds between retries.',
      type: 'number',
      default: '0',
      required: false,
    },
  }}
/>

## Events

### On before upload

Callback that is called before requesting the pre-signed URLs. Use this to modify the files before uploading them, like resizing or compressing. You can also throw an error to reject the file upload.

```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onBeforeUpload: ({ files }) => {
    // rename all files
    return files.map(
      (file) => new File([file], 'renamed-' + file.name, { type: file.type })
    );
  },
});
```

### On upload begin

Event that is called before the files start being uploaded to S3. This happens after the server responds with the pre-signed URLs.

```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadBegin: ({ files, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload begin');
  },
});
```

### On upload progress

Event that is called when a file upload progress changes.

```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadProgress: ({ file }) => {
    console.log(`${file.name} upload progress: ${file.progress * 100}%`);
  },
});
```

### On upload complete

Event that is called after files are successfully uploaded.

```tsx
// This event is called even if some files fail to upload, but some succeed.
// This event is not called if all files fail to upload.
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadComplete: ({ files, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log(`${files.length} files uploaded`);
  },
});
```

### On upload fail

Event that is called after the entire upload if a file fails to upload.

```tsx
// This event is called even if some files succeed to upload, but some fail.
// This event is not called if all files succeed.
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadFail: ({ succeededFiles, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Some or all files failed to upload');
  },
});
```

### On error

Event that is called if a critical error occurs before the upload to S3, and no files were able to be uploaded. For example, if your server is unreachable.

```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onError: (error) => {
    console.log(error.message);
  },
});
```

<Callout>
  This event is also called if some input is invalid. For example, if no files
  were selected.
</Callout>

### On upload settle

Event that is called after the upload settles (either successfully completed or an error occurs).

```tsx
useUploadFiles({
  route: 'demo',
  onUploadSettle: ({ files, failedFiles, metadata }) => {
    console.log('Upload settled');
  },
});
```

## Metadata

It is possible to send metadata from the client to your server on the upload request.

```tsx
export function MyComponent() {
  const { upload } = useUploadFiles({
    route: 'demo',
  });

  return (
    <input
      type="file"
      multiple
      onChange={(e) => {
        if (e.target.files) {
          upload(e.target.files, {
            // [!code highlight:3]
            metadata: {
              folder: 'my-folder',
            },
          });
        }
      }}
    />
  );
}
```

<Callout>
  You can validate the client metadata on the server by setting the
  `clientMetadataSchema` option in the upload route.
</Callout>
